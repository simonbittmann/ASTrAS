Known Issues

General:
- Saving figures as png does not reproduce the figure dimensions to 100 % (but approximately).
  If perfect reproduction is required, save as .svg or .pdf and convert to png.
  saving as jpg does not work currently.

TA App:
- since matplotlib update, movie saving results in crash or empty file. Button currently disabled.

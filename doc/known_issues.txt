Known Issues

General:
- Saving figures as png does not reproduce the figure dimensions to 100 % (but approximately).
  If perfect reproduction is required, save as .svg or .pdf and convert to png.
  saving as jpg does not work currently.

TA App:
- since matplotlib update, movie saving results in crash or empty file. Button currently disabled.
- Saving trace to .mat file does not work properly. .txt works.

Linefit:
- After setting bounds and back to None, fit does not work as before.
	Need to check that. Also add reset button for fix.
